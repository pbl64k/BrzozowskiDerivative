This is a context-free grammar recognizer based on Brzozowski derivatives.

The recognizer was written as a part of evaluation effort of alternatives to
finite automata ad hockery and Picoparsec (other approaches under
consideration were Earley and CYK).

PHP is close to being the opposite of the ideal language for BD parsers.
Inspecting the code should give you a good idea why, and running will
demonstrate just how bad it is. I cannot guarantee correctness, but the
implementation follows the methodology described in the papers closely.
Initial results were bad enough I consider this a fascinating curiosity but
not a viable option for parsing in production. (It's worth mentioning that
upgrading this to an actual parser would also involve substantial effort -
and further overhead.)
